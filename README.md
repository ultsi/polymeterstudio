Simple LOVE 2D-application that allows you to create polymetric music.

Intended originally to be used live to create minimalistic music. Has some visuals for the music, currently all the sequences are shown as Circle-visuals, which show the notes and where the current beat in the sequence is. The finished product was intended to have particle effects and so on to visualize the music. Also the colour scheme was intended to change according to the current harmony. Both should be easy to implement if one knows about music theory.

The ultimate point of this application was to offer an intuitive UI to create polymetric music without needing a 'master' meter of some sort. For example: in FL Studio you have to choose a meter for your project, you can't make sequences that go around in cycles. It's easier nowadays though, but it still isn't easy enough to create polymetric music.

What is polymetric music?
Polymetric music has one simple idea: have two or more distinct melodies or rhythms that go in different meters. For example you could have a drum track going in 4/4 and a melody that goes in 5/4. Basically the meter would be 20/4 (5*4=20), but when you start to add other tracks that go in 7/4 and 9/16, it starts to be difficult to write in one signature only.
